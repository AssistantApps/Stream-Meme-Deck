### The Goal:

I wanted to add a bit more life to me streams be adding silly images as an overlay while we were busy coding, gaming, whatever. Using this page and capturing the window this page is running off, you can control what is being displayed on your overlay easily and be able to manage the content easily

### Features:

- Drag and drop images onto the page
- Right click an image to enable resizing it
- Paste image from clipboard
- Press the delete key to remove the highlighted image
- Press escape (or click off the image) to deselect
